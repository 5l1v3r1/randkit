# randkit
 Random number rootkit for the Linux kernel

The goals are to see:
* how a kernel module can access and modify the `/dev/urandom` and `/dev/random` structures.
* what happens when we replace a cryptographically secure PRNG with a predictable and reversible PRNG (here, this simple PRNG is `xor128`).

Contents
=

zero/
-

A simple module that replaces `/dev/(u)random` with `/dev/zero`

xor128/
-

A module that replaces `/dev/(u)random` with a simple predictable and reversible PRNG.

This PRNG is called *xor128* and is part of the very fast Xorshift PRNGs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift

One of the *xor128* features is that it passes the *diehard* random number tests: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests

Therefore it is difficult to distinguish a predictable PRNG like *xor128* with a **really** random CSPRNG like `/dev/urandom`.

fops/
-

A module that checks that the `struct file_operations` pointer from `/dev/urandom` is accessible using different techniques

tests/
-

Programs to test that the modules work correctly (e.g. read random numbers from the file descriptor, syscall, ...).

examples/
-

Shows how to retrieve past random numbers generated by the `randkit_xor128` module.

Build
=

Go inside the `zero/` or `xor128/` directories and type `make`.

You need the linux headers for your kernel.

Test
=

Go to the `examples/` directory and type `make`.

This will encrypt data using a key generated by the backdoored PRNG, and will try to decrypt it by retrieving the PRNG previous values.
